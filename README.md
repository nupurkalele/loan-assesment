This project aims to analyze and assess loan data to derive insights and make informed decisions. By leveraging statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, the project provides a comprehensive evaluation of loan applications, helping lenders mitigate risks and optimize lending strategies.

Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes robust data preprocessing techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the loan data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed exploratory analysis provides insights into the distribution, trends, and patterns within the loan dataset.

Feature Engineering: Utilizes feature engineering to derive new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of machine learning models.

Machine Learning Models: Implements various machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests, or gradient boosting to predict loan defaults or assess creditworthiness.

Model Evaluation: Employs metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of machine learning models.

Interactive Visualization: Incorporates interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to communicate insights effectively.
